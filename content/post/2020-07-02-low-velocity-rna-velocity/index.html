<p>I’ve been doing some work with RNA velocity lately and I thought this was a good opportunity to write my first blog post. I’m going to go through different aspects of it pretty slowly over a few posts, hence the “low velocity” in the title.</p>

<h2>Background reading</h2>
<p>If you want to read about the biology behind RNA velocity you can go to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0414-6">original publication</a>. If that takes you to a paywall you can read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/206052">preprint</a> or get a pdf from the first author’s website <a href="http://gioelelamanno.com/">la manno lab &gt; publications</a>. The software associated with the publication lives at <a href="http://velocyto.org/">velocyto.org</a>. Later on I’ll be using <a href="https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/">scvelo</a> which you can read about in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/820936">this preprint</a>.</p>
<p>Some helpful background to modelling gene expression with differential equations can be found in:</p>
