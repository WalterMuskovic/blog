## Me
I'm Walter Muskovic, a computational biologist based in Sydney, Australia. I'm currently working as a post-doc at the [Garvan Institute of Medical Research](https://www.garvan.org.au/) investigating brain tumours using single cell genomics techniques, with a particular focus on single-cell RNA-seq.

## The blog
I started this blog as a way to keep track of interesting things I come across or try out at work, like new R packages or interesting data sets. I do most things in R and I'm planning to write these blogs with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Never written a blog before, so apologies if links don't work or your browser catches fire.
