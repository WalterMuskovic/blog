## Me
I'm Walter Muskovic, a computational biologist based in Sydney, Australia. I finished my PhD in 2018 (!!! still exciting to say !!!) and I'm currently working as a post-doc at the [Children's Cancer Institute](https://ccia.org.au/) investigating non-coding RNAs in brain cancer. Research interests outside the day-to-day include; transcription dynamics, gene regulation, comparative genomics, microRNAs and  RNA-seq time series. In fact any *-seq time series and I'm there. 

## The blog
I thought I'd start this blog mostly as a way to keep track of things I've done. A blog also sounded like an interesting way of trying out new tools, exploring interesting data sets, figuring things out and sharing anything I pick up along the way. I do most things in R and I'm planning to write these blogs with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Never written a blog before, so apologies if links don't work or your browser catches fire.
